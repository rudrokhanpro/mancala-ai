START : At the start of the game each pit has 4 stones

MOVE : Select a pit from 1-6 to move the stones in an anti-clockwise direction

RE-TURN : When the last stone ends in your Mancala, you can play again
SCORE : Scores are counted in your Mancala (left and right extremities)
        When a stone you moved passes in your Mancala you add +1 point
END : The game ends when either your side or the enemy side has no more playable pit
     We count the stones in your Mancala + the stones on your side to 
determine the winner
